⚡ Coulomb’s Law Interactive Simulator 🎯
This project is an interactive Coulomb’s Law Simulator 🧲 designed to help users visualize and understand the relationship between electric force, charge, and distance. Using real-time calculations and dynamic graphics 📊, the simulator demonstrates how charged particles interact under electrostatic forces.

✨ Key Features:
✅ User-Friendly Controls – Adjust the Angle (°) 🎛️ and Length (cm) 📏 using intuitive sliders.
✅ Real-Time Calculations 🧮 – Dynamically updates values like Force due to Gravity (Fg), Electric Force (Fe), Distance (x), Charge (q), and Electrons (e⁻).
✅ Interactive Graph 📈 – A live-updating chart visualizes how the electric force changes with different inputs.
✅ Smooth Animations & Responsive UI 🎨 – A sleek, modern interface that works seamlessly across all devices.

🚀 How It Works:
1️⃣ Adjust the Angle (°) and Length (cm) using the sliders.
2️⃣ Click "Simulate" 🔄 to trigger calculations based on Coulomb’s Law and physics equations.
3️⃣ Instantly see the updated results in the table 📋.
4️⃣ Watch the graph update in real-time 📊, showing the force variations dynamically.
